# üçÖ Pomodoro Timer

## What It Does 

The app allows you to:
- Set a simple Pomodoro timer complete with work, rest, and long rest cycles.
- Keep track of how many work-rest intervals you've completed
- Adjust the length of the different cycles

## Project Structure

Basic trio of HTML + CSS + JS w/an assets folder for now

`biome.json` configures the Biome LSP for various web filetypes (namely HTML/JSON) which I use w/my Nvim config

## Notes

This is my first frontend project, so you may see some disasters in the code! Learning and getting it done was the main objective here :)
